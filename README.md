# GraziosoSalvare
## About
Grazioso Salvare international rescue-animal training company. As part of its work, Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. When trained, these dogs are able to find and help to rescue humans or other animals, often in life-threatening conditions. To help identify dogs for training, Grazioso Salvare has reached an agreement with a non-profit agency that operates five animal shelters in the region around Austin, Texas. This non-profit agency will provide Grazioso Salvare with data from their shelters.

## Motivation
- Develops database queries that match the required filter functionality and utilize the previous CRUD Python module for direct MongoDB access.

- Creates interactive options that allow for the selection of data based on filtering functions and the control of other dashboard widgets, and demonstrates successful executions by providing screenshots with a unique identifier.

- Creates an interactive data table that responds to input from other controls, and demonstrates successful executions by providing screenshots with a unique identifier.

- Creates charts to display data in response to inputs from other controls, and demonstrates successful executions by providing screenshots with a unique identifier.

## Getting Started
The AAC database has the animals collection. There is admin and user authentication to the database with different privileges. I created Create and Read functions for the database that allows me to insert data into the collection and then uses the find function.

## Installation and Tools
MongoDB, Python 3+/Jupyter, and PyMongo driver

## Usage
Installing MongoDB, installing/importing the (csv) data, setting up user authentication, implementing CRUD operations as a Python module, and building an app that uses the CRUD module are all stages in duplicating the project.

## Contact
- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?


- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?


- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
